    Telegram Team deleted your account?
    And after that, then you pointed your fingers at us
    for getting your acoount deleted?

## What is it?

PaperplaneMinimal is a minimalist fork of the Paperplane userbot, no database and only with modules that I (Hitalo) find useful and necessary for my use of Telegram.

## Install guide

Make sure you are running python3.6, I cannot guarantee everything will run fine. Also be sure you are using Telethon 1.10.

Start by installing the python dependencies. In the same directory as requirements.txt run

`python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

This will install all the required dependencies. After this, you need to copy and expand the sample configuration file. Create a new file named `config.py` and make sure in the header you have `from tg_userbot.sample_config import Config`. After that just copy the contents of the Config class in the `sample_config.py` file to your new file, fill in with your data and you should be done. You need your user API key and hash, you can get those in the [Telegram Core API](https://my.telegram.org/) website.
 
With these done, you should be ready to run your bot, follow the instructions in Starting up section. Good luck.
